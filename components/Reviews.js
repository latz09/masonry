My spouse and I couldn not be happier with the work and it was a pleasure to work with Dylan on this project. I would not hesitate to use D&D Masonry again nor hesitate about recommending him to others.',

		Text: 'Dylan came out to rebuild our chimney from the roofline up. His quote came in lower than all others and I was very pleased with Dylans communication, speed of work, and customer service. He worked with us to find the bricks we wanted, ensured everything was properly sealed up during the process, and walked me through everything he was doing. I would suggest Dylan (and D&D) for anyones masonry needs!',

		Text: 'My husband and I are very particular, and Dylan completely exceeded our expectations!   Not only is he professional, responsive, honest, AND reasonably priced, he is a true artisan that takes extreme pride in his work.  The repairs he made on our brick house are impeccable PLUS there was not one speck of dust remaining when he was done.  Easiest 5 stars Iâ€™ve ever given to a contractor.',
